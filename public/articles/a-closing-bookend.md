4 years and 10 months ago, I sent an unsolicited email:

> Hi Adam,

> After hearing about Heroku for the first time Sunday at the SF hack day after the gogaruco, I've been totally blown away with your offering.  I'm developing a RoR site, and your solution is clear the "Right Way"(TM) of hosting.  I'm so impressed, I wanted to reach out and see if I could help you guys out in any way.

> My day job, when I'm not trying to create the next great RoR fitness site, is in Marketing and Product Management for infrastructure companies.  From my early days as a sysadmin working with Evi Nemeth and helping on the unix book, working for Paul Vixie all the way through my recent experience with Sun in the systems management and virtualization group, and my current job with Replicate, I've focused on making infrastructure solutions better and easier.  For the past few years, I've focused on agile customer driven product management and marketing, helping my companies build products customers love and care about.  I've done the VC dog & pony (though perhaps not perfectly, Replicate only raised 1.5M and we're hurting now), built some great products, generated customer demand, and had a blast doing it.  I'd love to talk with you guys, and help you succeed as well.

> I live in Palo Alto, and would love to come up to SF, perhaps meet for
lunch, and see if there's any interest.

When I saw Heroku, I instantly fell in love. I knew it was what I wanted to do with my time. I joined a month later; our first 'product management' person. It's amazing to reflect back with some fun numbers:

* May 2009 Billings: $1,162. (That is in dollars. Yes, one thousand dollars).
* May 2009 Employees: 9
* May 2009 Apps: ~25,000 or so as I recall 
* Dec 2010 Apps: 100,000 or so
* Jan 2010 Employees (Salesforce.com acquisition): 25
* Jan 2011 Apps: Over 1 Million


Today was my last day at Heroku. I'm incredible proud of what we've built, and I can't wait to see where the team takes Heroku in the future. I'm spending some time advising a few of my favorite companies, enjoying life, and thinking about what's next. If you're working on somethign amazing in the space, and want some feedback, drop me a line.
