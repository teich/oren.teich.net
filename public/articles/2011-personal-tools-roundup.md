I'm a bit obsessed with hacking my tools selection for optimum... um... not productivity. Enjoyment? Satisfaction? Self-actualization?</p>
<p>Regardless, I play with a lot of various tools. The past few months I've been pretty stable so it seems like a good year-end time to share.</p>
<p><strong>Launcher: </strong><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred.app</a>. It's clean and fast. I don't use any special fancy features, but I bought the powerpack to support the developers anyway.</p>
<p><strong>General Content Sync: </strong><a href="http://db.tt/4FszxtAO">Dropbox</a>. I purchased the 50GB level. I have all my actual docs here, but don't have my media or anything crazy large like that. Usinng 18GB of my 50 right now. I right now keep my docs unencrpyted, but have at times used encrypted FS tools. Not sure what the best thing here is.</p>
<p><strong>Todo Management</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Cultured Code Things</a>. I use my todo list in a quasi-<a href="http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd">GTD</a> kind of way. I try to offload anything I know I need to do into there, keep my inbox 0, etc. I don't usually have a ton of todos - I factor aggressively and throw things away. Usually I've got 20-50 things max, including the 'someday' items that I really just delete months later. I've tried every todo thing I could get my hands on, and ultimately settled on Things for one main reason - it's quick entry dialog box.</p>
<p>A todo manager is useless if you don't get things into it. For me, this means having a single key-stroke access at all times. I've setup my computer so control-option-space brings up this awesome dialog box. You can see in this case it includes a snippit of text from this blog post. If I'm in mail, it'll include a link to the message. If you're on a webpage, it includes the URL. You never lose context this way.</p>
<p>This one feature has driven almost all of my other tool selection.</p>
<p>Up until recently, the lack of a working sync solution with Things has killed me. They've become more open in their beta program however, and it seems like just about anyone can get in to the beta by dropping them an email. Now that I can cloud sync between my iPhone, iPad, 2 work laptops (don't ask) and home iMac I'm very very happy.</p>
<p><strong>Mail: </strong><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/new_index">Mailplane.app</a>. I've found gmail with <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6594">keyboard shortcuts</a> to be far and away the fastest way to manage email. If you don't know the keyboard shortcuts, go take a week and learn them. I've tried sparrow and mail.app and neither can hold a candle on speed to just gmail. The thing is, I don't like just having a tab open. I like to be able to cmd-tab over to my email. Or fire up alfred and just type something to switch. This means I need a dedicated applicaiton. For a few years I used fluid.app which mostly works awesome. However, it doesn't support the all-important things quick entry discussed above. So fluid.app out, and mailplane.app in!</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvALT</a>&nbsp;(fork of Notational Velocity). Notational Velocity is&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">revelatory</span>. Just go try it. It's harder to explain than use. I use the nvALT fork because it supports Markdown preview. Otherwise it's identical. I store my files as plain text in a dropbox folder so I can access my notes on-the-go through <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a>.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering about notes vs. todo. Notes never have actions. It's literally just notes. I often will review my notes, and create tasks in things based on what I've written.</p>
<p><strong>Calendar:</strong>&nbsp;Google Cal &amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.busymac.com/">BusyCal</a>. Google is my canonical source of calendars. I actually have 2 calendars - one on heroku.com, and one on my personal teich.net domain. Work things go on the work cal, personal things on the personal. Yes, this means my free/busy is never correct. For me, I do 99% of my meetings on business, so it's fine. For some people, this may not work at all.</p>
<p>For desktop access, I'm currently using BusyCal. It's not perfect, but it's decent. Meh.</p>
<p><strong>Password Management: </strong><a href="http://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> of course. It works. It syncs with dropbox across all my devices. Done.</p>
<p><strong>Backups: </strong>I have 2x 1TB drives. I keep 1 plugged in at work at all times, the other at home. My MBA Time Machine backups when I leave it alone for a bit. Sometimes I go a few weeks without backing up. Living life on the edge! Every month I swap the drives home/work.</p>
<p><strong>Screenshot Management: </strong><a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/">LittleSnapper</a>. I can't believe how much I use this. At least 2x a week. I use it a poor-mans-OLAP DB (take screenshots of data over time to compare). I use it to capture customer sites. I use it to get nice long screenshots instead of just what's on screen (since all the plugins like awesome screenshot seem to never work for me). And it keeps from cluttering my filesystem. I only use this for full app screenshots, not small snapshots. For that I just use the built in system capability (shift-command-4 space).</p>
<p><strong>File Sharing: </strong><a href="http://getcloudapp.com/">Cloud.app</a>. 90% of my cloud.app usage is for sharing small screenshots over IM. Take a screenshot, and BAM you've got a URL to it: <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">http://cl.ly/1I1y3j043V0o0G2p3Q1i It just works. Of course you can share bigger files by dragging them to the menubar as well. It's just awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Hope this is helpful for anyone out there curious about what I'm doing these days. Love to hear what you're doing too.</span></p>
